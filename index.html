        <h2> PRACTICAL 10

            Practical on any Business Intelligence application.
            a) Problem definition, identifying which data mining task is needed
            b) Identify and use a standard data mining dataset available for the problem.
            
        </h2>

        <p>
            Problem Definition : Classify Iris flowers into species based on features.
Data Mining Task : Classification.

Step 1 : 
Open the WEKA application and the first page is displayed where you have the option to choose from various applications that WEKA supports.

Step 2 : 
Click on “Explorer” and the below image is shown

Step 3 : 
Click on “Open File” and then open the “iris” dataset.

Step 4 : 
Click on the “Choose” button. Choose the “Normalize” filter and then click “Apply”

Missing values can be checked by using the “ReplaceMissingValues” filter.

Step 5 : 
Go to the “Classify” tab 

Click on “Choose” then select “J48” from “trees”. 

Select the column required, then click on “Start”. Here. the column chosen is “class”


Right click on the J48 tab and select “Visualize tree”



Now, the model can also be used to experiment with different classifiers and other algorithms to enhance their performance. 
It can then be interpreted and used to make predictions on new instances of iris flowers and can also be deployed for classification of iris flowers in real-time.
